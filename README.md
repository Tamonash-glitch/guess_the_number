# guess_the_number
Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback to the user, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number.

Usage
Run the program.
Enter your guess when prompted.
If the guess is incorrect, the program will provide feedback to help you narrow down your next guess.
Keep guessing until you correctly guess the target number.
After finishing the game, the program will check if you have broken the high score (the lowest number of attempts). If so, it will update the high score in the hiscore.txt file.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Instructions
Download or clone the code from the repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code.

Note
The hiscore.txt file is used to store the high score. Make sure the file is present in the same directory as the Python script.
